This website serves as a portfolio of my work to date. I intend to continue to update and add links to works as they are created. 

As of May 2022, my only coding experience has been thanks to two Bitwise Industries Workforce Training classes in early 2022 (Websites for Beginners and Mobile Friendly Websites) and some self-taught skills. It is my intention to continue down this path of learning and developing my skills.
